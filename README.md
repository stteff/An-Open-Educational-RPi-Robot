# [OpEdRo] An-Open-Educational-(RPi)-Robot

An Educational Robotic Platform, Raspberry Pi based, using Open Technologies. Remotely programmable from Scratch to move specific distances, to turn certain angles, to speak text and variable values.

### Installing and Setting up Raspberry Pi's Operating System
---
  1. > Download [Raspbian Stretch Lite](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/) image file
  2. > Unzip the compressed file
  3. > Use the [Etcher](https://etcher.io/) SD card utility (or a similar one) to transfer the Raspbian to the SD card
  4. > Connect Raspberry Pi to an internet network using an Ethernet cable and boot
  5. > Log in as *pi* user
  6. > Invoke the configuration utility *raspi-config*, by typing at the command line interface:
     > ```
     > sudo raspi-config
     > ```
  7. > Enable remote command line access using ssh, in order to allow remote access to the robot:
  
     > 7a. Select *Interfacing Options:*
     > ![Step 7a](/docs/images/2.png)
     
     > 7b. Select *SSH:*
     > ![Step 7b](/docs/images/3.png)

  8. > Set WiFi SSID and pass phrase of the network where robot will be connected:
  
     > 8a. Select *Network Options:*
     > ![Step 8a](/docs/images/4.png)
     
     > 8b. Select *Wi-fi:*
     > ![Step 8b](/docs/images/6.png)
  9. > Check the wlan (wireless lan) IP assigned.
     
     > Exit raspi-config and type:
     > ```
     > ifconfig
     > ```
     > At the *wlan0:* part of the command output, the new IP should appear:
     >
     > ![Step 9](/docs/images/7.png)
  10. > Set a Static IP for the Raspberry Pi [Optional] 
  
      > You will need:
      > - a valid static IP address (at the example below, *192.168.2.200*)
      > - the router's and domain_name_servers' IP addresses (usually same IP for both, at the example below *192.168.2.1*)
      >
      
      > At the command line type:
      > ```
      > sudo nano /etc/dhcpcd.conf
      > ```
      > Go to the end of the file and type (adjust accordingly to your IPs):
      > ```
      > interface wlan0
      > static ip_address=192.168.2.200/24
      > static routers=192.168.2.1
      > static domain_name_servers=192.168.2.1
      > ```
      > Save changes, exit nano and reboot by typing:
      
<p>
  <kbd>
      Ctrl
  </kbd> + <kbd>O</kbd>  to confirm write to the file
</p>

      > <p><kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>X</kbd>  to exit the nano editor</p>
      >
      > `sudo reboot` for changes to take effect

### Remote Access Rapsberry Pi's Command Line Interface (CLI)
---
Since the IP addresss of the Raspberry Pi is known (assuming ~192.168.2.200~ for demonstration purposes), one could connect to its CLI from another computer of the same network
  * If you are on a Windows environment, you will firstly need to install an *ssh terminal client* program (e.g. [PuTTY](https://www.putty.org/)) and configure it to connect to ~192.168.2.200~
  * If you are on a Unix environment, open a terminal window and type:
  
    `ssh pi@192.168.2.200`

### Installing Necessary Python Libraries
---
  1. > Update and upgrade installed packages:
  
     > ```
     > sudo apt-get update
     > sudo apt-get upgrade
     > ```
  2. > Install scratchpy:
  
     > Firstly obtain the python package manager, *pip*
     > ```
     > sudo apt-get install python-pip
     > ```
     
     > Then continue with the scratchpy:
     > ```
     > pip install scratchpy
     > ```
  3. > Install the pigpio library:
  
     > ```
     > wget abyz.co.uk/rpi/pigpio/pigpio.zip
     > unzip pigpio.zip
     > cd PIGPIO
     > make
     > sudo make install
     > ```
  4. > Install the espeak package:
  
     > ```
     > sudo apt-get install python-espeak
     > ```
  
## `The Control Computer:-----`
  * Any computer capable to run Scratch 1.4 (the version supporting the [Mesh](https://en.scratch-wiki.info/wiki/Mesh) method)
  * Connected to the same LAN as Raspberry Pi
