# [OpEdRo] An-Open-Educational-(RPi)-Robot
An Educational Robotic Platform, Raspberry Pi based, using Open Technologies, remote controled from Scratch

***
*`This project is in active development. Additions will be taking place on a regular basis`*
***
### `OpEdRo:-----`
List of main components used:
  * A robot chassis appropriate to host the rest of the parts
  * A Rapsberry Pi 3 model B
  * 2 micro servo motors fitable to robot chassis
  * 2 photoelectric sensors
  * 2 encoder disks
  * 1 battery holder for 4xAA to power the servos
  * 1 power bank for Raspberry Pi
  * 1 small portable speaker with 3.5 mm jack (for the speech engine)
  
  
Raspberry Pi Software used: 

  * Operating system
    * Raspbian Jessie Lite (Lite version uses lower computer resources)
  * Python 2.7.x
  * Python packages / modules
    * [RPi.GPIO](https://sourceforge.net/p/raspberry-gpio-python/wiki/Home/ "RPi.GPIO Wiki") (a class to control the GPIO on a Raspberry Pi, included with OS)
    * [pigpio](http://abyz.me.uk/rpi/pigpio/index.html "The pigpio Documentation") (a library supporting hardware timed servo pulses)
    * [scratchpy](https://github.com/pilliq/scratchpy) (a python client for Scratch)
    * [espeak](http://espeak.sourceforge.net/ "espeak Documentation") (a text to speech engine)
  
### `The Control computer:-----`
  * Any computer capable to run Scratch 1.4 (the version supporting the [Mesh](https://en.scratch-wiki.info/wiki/Mesh) method)
  * Connected to the same LAN as Raspberry Pi

## Installing and Setting up Raspberry Pi's Operating System
  1. Download [*Raspbian Stretch Lite*](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/) image file
  2. Extract files from the zip
  3. Use the [Etcher](https://etcher.io/) SD card utility (or a similar one) to transfer the Raspbian to the SD card
  4. Connect Raspberry Pi to an internet network using an Ethernet cable and boot
  5. Log in as pi user
  6. At the command line interface, invoke the configuration utility raspi-config:
  ```
  sudo raspi-config
  ```
  7. Enable remote command line acccess using ssh:
    * Select *Interfacing Options*
